# Figaro (modified template from webflow)

The idea of the project is for the user to be able to book an appointment with their barber. Currently, a booking option is under construction. You are able to register your account or login with existing. For authorization I used firebase hooks.

### Technologies and tools I used

⚫ Reactjs
